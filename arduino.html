    <p>In a nutshell, an Arduino is an open hardware development board that can be used by tinkerers, hobbyists, and makers to design and build devices that interact with the real world. While Arduino refers to a specific type of board design, it can also be used to refer to a company which manufactures a specific implementation of these boards, and is typically also used to describe the community around compatible boards made by other people or companies which function in a similar way.
